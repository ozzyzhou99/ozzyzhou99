## About Me
Hello! I'm Zhongyu Zhou, a graduate student in Geographic Information Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. I completed my undergraduate studies in Geographic Information Science at the China University of Petroleum (East China).

## Education
- **Master of Arts in Geographic Information Science** (Expected May 2025) - University at Buffalo, SUNY
  - Cumulative GPA: 3.73/4.0
- **Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science** (June 2021) - China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China
  - Cumulative GPA: 3.3/4.0

## Research Interests
- **GIS Spatial Data Analysis**: Focusing on geospatial network analysis, spatial accessibility, and disparities.
- **Data Science**: Employing simulation and modeling for complex social and environmental data, specifically using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).
- **Transportation**: Analyzing and improving transportation systems for enhanced accessibility through ABM and GIS tools.

## Research & Projects
- **Simulating Airport Emergency Evacuation in Response to a Gunman Threat**:
  - Developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate emergency evacuation scenarios at an airport. The model incorporates GIS data to manage the spatial elements of the airport environment, focusing on optimizing evacuation routes and improving safety protocols during high-risk situations.

- **Development of a Mobile Surveying Platform Application Using KQGIS**:
  - Engineered an Android-based application using KQGIS to enhance field surveying and mapping capabilities. This project involved programming map visualization, mobile positioning, and layer editing features to improve data collection accuracy and efficiency.

- **Analysis of Transportation Accessibility for Disabled Persons on UB North Campus**:
  - Employed GIS and network analysis to assess and improve campus transportation services for disabled individuals.

- **Selection of Prime Fishing Spots for Smallmouth Bass in Lake Erie**:
  - Applied logistic regression to create predictive models for smallmouth bass habitats based on environmental factors.



## Technical Skills
- **GIS Tools**: Proficient in ArcGIS
- **Programming**: 
  - **Current Proficiency**: Python, R
  - **Previous Experience**: Java, C#
- **Software Development**: Experienced in Android Studio, ENVI, and Erdas for remote sensing applications.


## Honors and Awards
